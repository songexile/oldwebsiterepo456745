<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<h4><em>Issues
Some of the major issues that are presented with the topic of internet speech are that anything and everything posted online is there forever, meaning that anyone at any point in time could see it. This can come into effect when someone gets a background check on them, anything that comes up with their name on the internet could result in significant consequences for the individual. There have been certain cases where people are removed from high positions in an organization because of what they have said years ago. Another big issue with this topic would be that there are certain outlets on the dark web and even some on the surface level web that feature terrorism and other forms of highly illegal activity discussions. An example of this would be mass shooting that happened in Christchurch on the 15th of March in 2019, where the perpetrator shared a 74-page manifesto on a website called 8Chan. This is an example of unethical information being spread across websites where users are able to post anonymously, the terrorist also livestreamed the entire attack on Facebook live, without the video being blocked or removed; ("Jacinda Ardern calls for ‘ethical algorithms’ to help stop online radicalisation," 2021) states that since then, the Christchurch Call has created a protocol to stop the transmission of such attacks.
Personal Reflection
Personally, I think that the general surface web should not be monitored as much as the deep web should be, 99% of the surface web is legal activity, the only things that make it suspicious or make it require supervision would be certain unmoderated websites where anything can be discussed without consequence. I also think that the deep web should be monitored thoroughly, the amount of illegal activity that takes place on it is a lot more than most people would expect, acts such as buying and selling of illegal substances, human trafficking, gore, purchasing and distribution of weapons, and even child pornography is present on the dark web. Personally, I think that there are far larger issues at hand, such as terrorism and spread of terrorism-related information/planning on the dark web, distribution of lethal drugs and harmful substances, and worst of all, child pornography. I personally think that the higher up who have access to a much larger chunk of the internet should be focusing their power over to the outliers of the general internet users, people who are planning to create havoc or distributing illegal items across the internet.
Recommendations
My personal recommendations would be to have lighter filtering on the surface web, meaning that only certain keywords would create alerts that would have to be monitored and later reported if they are false positives or genuine concerns. This would also mean that personal information is not sold off to advertisement firms as this creates a large hole in the privacy of a user and the information. Filtering on the dark web however should be strengthened, there are a lot more serious things that need to be addressed on the dark web which currently are not being dealt with, I think </em></h4><br>
