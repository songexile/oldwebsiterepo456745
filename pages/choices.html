<h1>Technology Choices</h1>


</ul><h4><p>With 4.66 billion active users online, which is 59.5% of the worldwide population (Kemp,2021), it is evident that we have become very dependent on this particular technology. The internet as we know it has become much more today than what it was in the last decade, and in that same time, individuals have come up with new ways to manipulate it to do evil deeds that sometimes the usual passerby wouldn’t think twice about. So this poses the question, what other forms of technology can we use instead? As the internet can certainly be healthy and unhealthy for many different reasons, there are choices that must be made for the betterment of our physical and mental health. Pagers were a very useful telecommunications device created in the 1950’s and became popular in the 80’s til they eventually became overrunned by mobile phones.Pagers were used in order to send messages that were brief and alerted the user whenever they received a message. Pagers today would provide people with the ability to just speak to their closer contacts and be alerted about something significant rather than be hounded with other spam messages that aren’t urgent and could potentially be malicious. The same could be said for mobile phones as they would only have a select few notable close contacts to interact with, without having to connect online. Sure in modern today, mobile phones are capable of connecting online via WiFi and Data Networks supplied by network providers. This could also be done through physical mail as this too is a great way to communicate to people who either live in different countries or don’t have a telecommunications device on them at all times. With physical mail, there is a lowered rate of spam and/or scams as 50% of physical mail is considered spam whilst 80% of emails is spam. Most direct mail sent is personal so that if mail is sent it would certainly be of importance to the receiver therefore, only subjects of importance are received. Given these alternatives to the internet, it is difficult to select, or rather, take it upon ourselves to follow through with other choices for the internet since it is already too far into its development and implementation into our modern life as we know it. However, the internet isn’t all bad, it just needs to be moderated more so in order to make it a more safer space for its users and their private and personal information. According to DeNardis and Hackl (2015), in order to have a safe private platform online for users, platforms must have anonymous speech and individual privacy, the ability to express and share ideas, freedom from censorship and technical affordances if interoperability and permissionless innovation. These assist with ensuring users human rights are still valid even in an online environment where their privacy may be targeted or opinions silenced. <p></h4>
