<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>


<p> Despite the youthful age of the internet, internet speech has given sound opportunities to people from around the world to improve their quality of life, make friends, learn, exchange ideas, and hang out virtually. Currently, in June 2021 there are over 1,863,000,000 websites live and this number continues to grow (Total number of Websites, 2021). The internet is not controlled by a single person, this means that anyone is welcome to express their view and to speak freely. Despite this, there is the exception of countries where the internet is censored or even banned, which according to Freedom of the net, is 35% of the world’s internet user population (Freedom on the net, 2018). </p>
 
<p>Internet speech allows for the new social phenomena which is online communities. These communities primarily revolve around people that share similar interests or ideas and allow for a place of belonging on the world wide web. Since the internet is a diverse place there are plentiful types of communities that are evolving with time. Such communities could be communities that have a common motive for health such as a fitness community, or a community for people into a type of game, a community for those into music or communities for those into education the types of communities are endless as the internet grows so do the communities. With every community there must be a way that the community interacts, such as a forum, a chatroom or even a virtual space such as VR (Virtual Reality). These communities allow for a sense of belonging and allow for those that are likely to struggle with social isolation such as the aging population to have increased resilience when dealing with isolation (Kamalpour, Watson & Buys, 2020). Due to old people being more isolated, social media and forums allow for old people to seek information and to connect with others, through social media aged populations can communicate from anywhere in the world. The opportunities that rise from aged populations being connected is increased connection and less alienation in society. </p>
 
<p>The COVID-19 virus outbreak that started in early 2020 forced a large number of people to go into isolation, where governments specifically told people to stay at home due to the rate at which the virus was spreading. This forced isolation caused a significantly large amount of people to be left at home with little to no social interaction, a lot of people were left unemployed as well due to companies losing profit, needing to cut down on wages. In a situation like this where there is no physical interaction, it becomes difficult to stay sane as social interaction and communication are natural human traits that we need to acquire. The internet however provides a means of instant communication, meaning someone can communicate to someone instantly while being halfway across the world from them. The internet provides almost the perfect solution to the COVID isolation problem, there was a significant jump in social media activity and other entertainment media during the lockdowns that happened/are still happening all across the world. According to ("virus changed the way we internet," 2020) by the New York Times, websites such a Facebook.com, Netflix.com and YouTube.com received much larger amounts of daily activity, Facebook.com went up around 27% after the first reported USA COVID-19 death, Netflix.com going up by around 16%, and YouTube.com going up by 15.3%. To combat with the lack of ways to connect physically due to isolation, apps such as Houseparty and Nextdoor.com received massive spikes of more than 70%, with Houseparty almost pulling in almost 80%. Apps like these provide video communication and make it a lot easier to talk to someone rather than having to use messaging platforms. One of the largest groups of people that were affected were people that were studying or attending any form of in-person study, this is where apps like Zoom, Google Classroom, and Microsoft Teams shot up in terms of popularity, as schools and other educational institutes could stream the classes and lectures online for the students, from the comfort of their own home.</p>
 
<p>Another opportunity of internet speech is its use in political use. Individuals are able to inform the public through social media for causes and bring attention to issues that the mainstream media chooses to ignore. Such as with George Floyd, an african american that was killed through acts of police brutality. After his death, the video which showcased police brutality was shared through social media creating a backlash and protests throughout the world (Cheung, 2020). The use of social media is crucial for internet speech and activism throughout the internet as it allows for rapid sharing. This is often called “Social Media Activism”. Social Media activism fights traditional media as there is no gate keep other than censorship from social media apps itself this means individuals can create movements for injustice in society. This has been seen with other movements such as ‘#Metoo movement’ which started due to sexual allegations from Harvey Weinstein which later resulted in him being charged of sex crimes (Puente, 2021). Social media allowed for the movement to thrive as people used the hashtag “#MeToo” which was started by Alyssa Milano urging sexual assault victims to speak up (Anderson & Toor, 2018). This movement aimed at helping those that were victims of sexual assault and to change how society as it meant that these victims could speak up.  (Zarkov & Davis, 2018). Social media allowed for the movement to thrive as people used the hashtag “#MeToo” which on October 11, 2018 was used over 19 million times on twitter (Anderson & Toor, 2018). These statistics demonstrate how powerful internet speech is in dealing with social issues as people can start movements online that can spread rapidly throughout the internet onto other social media platforms and media websites.</p>
