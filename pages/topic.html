<h1>Chosen Technology/Topic</h1>


<p>Internet speech and the technology around it is a significant topic in today’s world where an enormous amount of data is transmitted day by day, a lot of this data however is monitored and carefully removed if something does meet the guidelines, a large amount of the data through social media sites is also sold off to advertising firms and large companies for data processing for the purpose of targeted advertisements. This is where the topic of internet speech and free speech within the internet comes into play, this issue means that if something a user posts on the internet is considered propaganda or negatively related to current affairs, it will be removed along with numerous other posts about the topic, this is a form of filtering in which there are people higher up that are controlling and moderating a chunk of everything that is posted onto the internet. Free speech on the internet however has its importance, in certain countries where only certain types of news is allowed to be published, people in the outside world are unaware of the real events that occur within the country. Another large aspect of internet speech that makes it a highly relevant topic in today’s day and age is the of being able to spread misinformation and false accusations, this means that large companies and even whole parts of government sectors have to make decision carefully, an example would be the net neutrality case where there were entire protests online and people were rallying against the idea of removing net neutrality, ("Sign the petition," 2017) is a petition on Change.org that is still getting new signees every day, this petition currently has over 2.5 million people and the number is still rising. If net neutrality were abolished, a large part of the internet would have to suffer, specifically the consequences would be that ISPs are able to choose what information you see online and what is blocked off, meaning that they would have almost full control over what is shown and what is not, this makes it a critical example of how the idea of internet speech is important to our current society, we would lose almost all control of internet freedom if the petition was not made.<p>
