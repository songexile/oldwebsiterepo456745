<h1>Technology Risks</h1>


</ul><h4><p>Despite internet speech changing the way we live our lives; internet speech has resulted in risks in society. It has resulted in hate speech, terrorism, extremism, and other disturbing anti- societal behavior such as the livestreaming of a 15-year-old girl. These kinds of events continue due to the lack of control any person has in cyberspace, with many sites not even being monitored. Lack of control on the internet means that people can voice their opinion, good or bad. On April 23, 2018, a misogynist terrorist known as Alek Minassian who whom he describes himself as a “Incel” (involuntary celibate) rammed a rented van in Toronto, Canada killing 10 and injuring 16 (Cecco, 2021). Minassian was part of the involuntary celibate community online, in which he self-radicalized through the expose of misogynistic ideologies (Rozdilsky & Snowden, 2021) Prior to November 7, 2017, reddit.com/r/incels was a site in which involuntary celibates could openly talk. (Hauser, 2017) Since its ban, the involuntary celibate community has moved to other sites in which certain members own and control it. The radicalization of these groups such as involuntary celibates shows how dangerous internet speech can be, as it can band together those that share the same anti-societal views and can give them power to radicalize on the internet. Groups such as these pose risks as it is easy for people that browse the internet that share a similar view to become gradually radicalized. These groups pose risk to society as they operate in an antisocial way in which they can disrupt society for others.  
 
Using these new technologies also poses risk due to how reliant people are on them, often forgetting about the downsides regarding security, privacy, and information being sold to advertising agencies. As ("Facebook: A case study in ethics," 2018) states, Facebook, and other large firms such as Apple and Google target their advertisements towards users by utilising the information that has been sent to them, basic information is provided through the details a user enters when they sign up includes: full name, age, occupation, a rough location, family, and friends, etc. Other specific information that is sent can include groups that an individual is in, whether that be a sport team, gaming group, etc. Gathering this information is not a hard task for an advertising agency, this is what makes it scarier when considering how much insight the government and other officials could have when it comes to internet privacy and speech. Anything and everything that is posted on the internet is there forever, meaning it cannot be deleted, if someone posts a propaganda related post or anything that the government does not approve of, it could cause serious legal trouble. Another relevant case study done on Facebook.com, (Grubbs, 2011) states that any information that is shared with the website may be further passed on to undisclosed third parties that are not exclusively listed in the Terms of Use and Privacy Agreement. What is also stated is that Facebook does not clearly address what information and personal details will be used once the user accepts the agreement. This is a large hole in the company’s privacy documentation, however not much can be done as once the user accepts the privacy policy, they are legally bound to anything and everything that is written inside the document. 
 
Internet Speech also poses other risks such as hate speech. Hate speech is defined as a form of offensive language in which hate is expressed against a particular group often making use of stereotypes (Warner & Hirschberg, 2012). Hate speech is a genuine problem on the internet as hate speech can severely affect marginalized communities leading to feelings like that of PTSD in which the person that has experienced hate speech feels feelings of anxiety, denigration, nightmares, and other serious feelings (Saha, Chandrasekharan, & Choudhury, 2019). These effects have serious effects on people and society as hate speech can diminish quality of life and change how people view the world and can often split people of different races by increasing prejudice (Bilewicz & Winiewski, 2017) This leads to the world becoming split more on sex, race, and other personal identities. Despite this, there is an effort to slow down hate speech and eventually stop the harm of hate speech. Facebook has been using algorithms to stop hate speech, in the fourth quarter of 2020 6.3 million pieces of bullying and harassment content were found, compared to only 3.5 million in the third quarter (Rosen, 2021). This shows that there is an active effort to diminish the effects of hate speech on the internet. Despite this, more action needs to be taken using machine learning and other forms of technology. Hate speech can be diminished from the internet.
