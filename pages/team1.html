<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<p>There are many concerns ethically that surround the technology of internet speech. Such as conversations being spied on, the selling of private information, such as information in instant messaging applications or on forums. The app Messenger, owned by Facebook collects information such as browsing history, phone number search history, physical address and other details (Singh, 2021),  which they claim to use to enhance the app. Though, to much of the population this can be viewed as an excessive amount of data and information which a platform needs primarily to just send and receive messages. In the past Facebook/Messenger has had issues with privacy such as in the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal where Cambridge Analytica purchased Facebook data (Laposky, 2019) Internet speech is so powerful as it fuels one of the most basic human desires which is socializing. The ethics relating to these big corporations using and collecting personal data is dangerous as unless it is wiped, this personal data can last forever. Despite privacy policies being in place these companies still manage to have privacy breaches and in some cases they continue to break the laws as to them it is just another business expense.</p>

<p>Other ethical issues relating to internet speech is the bias from companies to push certain material. Whether for a personal reason or for profit, or for political interests. This happens with many websites on the internet, and more recently is happening with Microsoft's search engine Bing. In June, 2021 users across the world couldn't find any images when searching “tank man” , a search that holds high significance to Tiananmen Square (Cox, 2021). Despite this being said to be an accidental human error according to Bing. It is near impossible to know. Regardless, the censoring, whether accidental or not, helps hide the shocking event in which many were killed. The ethics in this is that this was censored in first-world countries around the world in which there was no internet censorship, except that opposed by Bing. This sort of censorship is dangerous as it can lead to people forgetting historical events and exposes western users of Bing to the same type of censorship of that in China. In the future censorship could even come into messaging apps such as with Chinese messaging app WeChat.</p>

<p>Personally I think that this is scary, as a future where political interest, interest for profits or for personal reasons is seriously dangerous and can lead people to using products that can slowly shift someone's opinion, which to me is basically manipulation. This is scary as internet speech/socializing is a keypoint of most people's lives. I know that whenever I use Messenger or other Instant Messaging apps such as Whatsapp or even Instagram messaging function that my data is being sold to try target ads and other products/ideas to me. Right now it seems as if we live in a time period where our personal conversations are harvested and unless our messages are encrypted it is hard to know what will be sold and if these companies are making profiles on us with the information that they collect.</p>

<p>My recommendation is that people should choose to use more products/services that support privacy or are open source or not for profit. As often when a service is free you are the product. When people communicate online instead of using apps created by big tech corporations they should use apps such as Signal or Internet Relay Chat in which users can set up servers. Other recommendations would be to put more pressure on the government to get privacy laws that tech companies must follow and rights which protect people from having their data harvested. Laws that stop political bias are extremely important also I believe. As there needs to be a way to charge companies that push politics unless they openly disclose this. People need to decide which is ethical and what kind of practices in the digital world that they should support. If everyone did this large businesses wouldn't get away with this kind of behavior</p>
