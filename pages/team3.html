<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<h5>In terms of objectivity, the internet, or rather, users on the internet, are anything but. As its many users tend to share their opinions on certain topics and to some instances, even cause a movement. Some of these movements can be positive or negative but in an online environment, the negative ones tend to be glorified the most. There is a negative movement online called cancel culture where certain people or even works of fiction get “cancelled” or in other words, to stop supporting a certain person or entity based on something that a group of people don’t agree with, which may or may not always be something criminal; may just be because of a different opinion on a childish topic. The privacy of users is lost in abundance as It is really easy for information to be leaked on the internet. This is shown by the amount of authentication required only to log in to certain online platforms compared to how logging on was in the last decade. Personally in my opinion, the internet is a great place to be, as long as you stay on its good side and are vigilant. The internet can open up opportunities and develop relationships which wouldn’t be accessible without it. It can also be a spectacular downfall if an easy mistake is made, such as said privacy breaches or stumbling upon something horrific completely by accident. Therefore, I personally recommend that people should be educated about how to be safe on the internet as it is certainly a broad place where an uneducated individual could trip up if they didn’t know any better
